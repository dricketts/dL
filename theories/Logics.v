(** This file defines the three logics in dL.
 ** - [StateProp] represents predicates over states
 **   (it is morally equal to dL).
 ** - [ActionProp] represents transitions between
 **   states (morally hybrid programs).
 ** - [FlowProp] represents predicates over variable
 **   values and their derivatives (these are used
 **   to describe continuous transitions in hybrid
 **   programs).
 **
 ** NOTE: The separation of [ActionProp] and [FlowProp]
 ** allows us to avoid the need to talk about derivatives
 ** in hybrid programs (except for during continuous
 ** evolution).

Section Logics.

  (** For defining these logics, there is no need to specify
      the structure of a state. Thus, we leave it abstract
      for maximum flexibility. When defining the specific
      operators of dL, we will specialize state to a particular
      type. *)
  Variable state : Type.

  (** [StateVal T] represents a value of type [T] which might
   ** depend on the current state.
   **)
  Record StateVal (T : Type) : Type := mkStateVal
    { unStateVal : state -> T }.

  (** [StateProp] is the type of predicates over a single state.
   **)
  Definition StateProp := StateVal Prop.

  (** [ActionVal T] represents a value of type [T] which might
   ** depend on either the pre-state or the post-state. Normally,
   ** this is used for stating predicates between two related states.
   **)
  Record ActionVal (T : Type) : Type := mkActionVal
    { unActionVal : state -> state -> T }.
  (** [ActionProp] represents a predicate over two states, e.g. a transition
   ** relation.
   **)
  Definition ActionProp := ActionVal Prop.

  (** Continuous transitions. *)
  (** We encode flows using arbitrary predicates [dF] over the values of variables
    and their derivatives. *)
  Record FlowVal (T : Type) : Type := mkFlowVal
    { unFlowVal : state -> state -> T }.
  Definition FlowProp : Type :=
    FlowVal Prop.

  (** The rest of the file defines "natural" structures that these types have.
   ** 
   ** Applictive Functor:
   **   Each XxxVal is an applicative functor which allows us to
   **   lift pure operations, such as addition, to operations over the XxxVal.
   **   For example, there is a canonical way to lift addition to addition over
   **   [StateVal]s.
   **
   **     [x + y] is a [StateVal R] if x and y are both [StateVal R]
   **
   ** Logic
   **   Each XxxProp is a logic (called an ILogic) which provides logical
   **   operators including the following:
   **   - ltrue (True) , lfalse (False)
   **   - a //\\ b (conjunction) , a \\// b (disjunction) , a -->> b (implication)
   **   - Forall x : T , P x (universal quantification over a value of type T)
   **   - Exists x : T , P x (existential quantification over a value of type T)
   **   - P |-- Q (entailment) , P -|- Q (bi-entailment, i.e. P |-- Q and Q |-- P)
   **     Entailment is morally the same as implication but it is a Coq proposition
   **     allowing us to prove it using Coq tools. For example, we can write a
   **     theorem:
   **
   **        Theorem my_lemma : forall P Q : StateProp,
   **           P //\\ Q |-- P.
   **
   **     in this definition, the [forall] is Coq's universal quantifier, and the entailment
   **     is between for the State logic. If we break the abstractions (defined subsequently)
   **     this theorem means exactly:
   **
   **        Theorem my_lemma_no_abs : forall P Q : StateProp,
   **           forall st : state, P st -> Q st.
   **
   **   In addition to the logical operators, logics also provide the core proof rules
   **   (and many derived proof rules and tactics) which allow us to prove the above theorems. 
   **   For example, [my_lemma] can be proved by the [charge_tauto] tactic.
   **
   **        Theorem my_lemma : forall P Q : StateProp,
   **           P //\\ Q |-- P.
   **        Proof.
   **          intros. (* to introduce Coq's foralls *)
   **          charge_tauto. (* prove the entailment *)
