  (* The safety property, i.e. the velocity is at most the
     upper bound. You have to write [get "v"] to access
     the current value of the velocity variable v. You also
     have to write [pure V] to express a constant. These are
     some of the many examples of how the syntax is very
     verbose in our embedding, but we hope to improve this
     in the future. *)

  (* The physical dynamics of the system. This formulation
     differs slightly from dL in that we explicitly set
     derivatives to zero. You write d["v"] [=] #[get "a"]
     to write that the derivative of the variable v is
     equal to the variable a. This syntax is pretty brutal
     and we would definitely like to improve it. The evolution
     invariant follows the [&] symbol. *)

  (* Theorem expressing that the system does enforce
     the upper bound on velocity. The proof is fairly simple
     and can probably be mostly or completely automated, but
     for the moment, we manually apply proof rules. Proof
     rules are applied contextually by [rewrite] or directly
     by [apply]. *)
