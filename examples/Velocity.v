Section VelocityBound.

  (* The upper bound on velocity. This is a symbolic constant. *)
  Variable V : R.
  (* Upper bound on the time between executions of
     the discrete controller. This is also a symbolic constant. *)
  Variable d : R.

  Notation "{@@ x , .. , y @@}" :=
    (Fields (FScons x%field_decl ..
                    (FScons y%field_decl FSnil) .. ))
    : type_scope.

  Definition state :=
    dL.state
      {@@ ("a" %e R)
       ,  ("v" %e R)
       ,  ("t" %e R)
       ,  ("y" %e R)
       @@}.

  (* The safety property, i.e. the velocity is at most the
     upper bound. You have to write [get "v"] to access
     the current value of the velocity variable v. You also
     have to write [pure V] to express a constant. These are
     some of the many examples of how the syntax is very
     verbose in our embedding, but we hope to improve this
     in the future. *)
  Definition safe : StateProp state :=
    get "v" [<=] pure V.

  (* The discrete controller sets the acceleration to some
     value that will be safe until the next execution. It
     also sets the timer to zero. *)
  Definition ctrl : ActionProp state :=
    "a" ::= ***;;
     ? get "v" [+] get "a"[*]pure d [<=] pure V;;
    "t" ::= pure 0.

  (* The physical dynamics of the system. This formulation
     differs slightly from dL in that we explicitly set
     derivatives to zero. You write d["v"] [=] #[get "a"]
     to write that the derivative of the variable v is
     equal to the variable a. This syntax is pretty brutal
     and we would definitely like to improve it. The evolution
     invariant follows the [&] symbol. *)

  Definition plant : FlowProp state :=
    d["v"] [=] #[get "a"] //\\
     d["a"] [=] pure 0.

  (* The next two should actually be about some NormedModule of state *)

  Definition evolveL : FlowProp state :=
    d["t"] [=] pure 1.

  Definition evolveR : StateProp state :=
    get "t" [<=] pure d.

  Definition plant2 : ActionProp state :=
    evolveL & evolveR.

  (* Theorem expressing that the system does enforce
     the upper bound on velocity. The proof is fairly simple
     and can probably be mostly or completely automated, but
     for the moment, we manually apply proof rules. Proof
     rules are applied contextually by [rewrite] or directly
     by [apply]. *)
